Haskell Solution to Project Euler
## Problem 1
```
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```
### Answer 1
```
sum [x | x <- [1..999], x `mod` 3 == 0 || x `mod` 5 == 0]
```
## Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Answer 2
```
fab :: Int -> Int
fab 1 = 1
fab 2 = 2
fab n = (fab (n-1)) + (fab (n-2))

fabList y = sum $ filter (\n -> n `mod` 2 == 0) $ takeWhile (<y) $ map fab [1..]
```
## Problem 3
```
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
