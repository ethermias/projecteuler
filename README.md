Haskell Solution to Project Euler
## Problem 1
```
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```
### Answer 1
```
sum [x | x <- [1..999], x `mod` 3 == 0 || x `mod` 5 == 0]
```
## Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Answer 2
```
fab :: Int -> Int
fab 1 = 1
fab 2 = 2
fab n = (fab (n-1)) + (fab (n-2))

fabList y = sum $ filter (\n -> n `mod` 2 == 0) $ takeWhile (<y) $ map fab [1..]
```
## Problem 3
```
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
```

### Answer 3

```
isDiv :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
isDiv y n
    | y `mod` n == 0 =  0
    | otherwise = n

step0 x y = last $ takeWhile (\z ->  z /= 0 ) $ map f [x..y] where f = isDiv y

step1 :: Integer -> Integer
step1 y = 1 + (step0 2 y) 

result :: Integer -> Integer
result x
      | mm  > 1 = result mm 
      | otherwise  = x
      where mm = x `div` (step1 x)
```

## Problem 4
```
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```
### Answer 4

```
maxNum :: Ord a => [a] -> a
maxNum [x] = x
maxNum (x:x':xs) = maxNum ((if x >= x' then x else x'):xs)

reverseInt = read . reverse . show
next n  = take 1 $ dropWhile (\z ->  z /= reverseInt z ) $ map (*n) [n, n-1..1]
min2 m = concat (map next [m, m-1..1])
```

## Problem 5
```
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```
### Answer 5
```
import Data.List
prime_factors n =
  case factors of
    [] -> [n]
    _  -> factors ++ prime_factors (n `div` (head factors))
  where factors = take 1 $ filter (\x -> (n `mod` x) == 0) [2 .. n-1]

all0 = map prime_factors [2..20]
all1 xs ys = intersect xs ys
all2 xs ys  = ys \\ (all1 xs ys)
all3 = foldl (\x acc -> (all2 acc x) ++ acc) [] all0
result = foldl (\x acc -> x * acc ) 1 all3
```
## Problem 6
```

Problem 6
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```
### Answer 6
```
step0 z = foldl (\x acc ->  ( acc + fst x, (acc ^ 2) + snd x)) (0,0) [1..z]
step1 z = ( (fst f) ^ 2)  - snd f  where f  = step0 z 
```

## Problem 7
```
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?
```
### Answer 7
```
result n = last $ take n $ sieve [2..]
sieve (p : xs) = p : sieve [ x | x <- xs, x `mod` p > 0 ]
```
